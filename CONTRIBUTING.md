# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.


## Testing

We have a handful of JUnit 5 Teasts, for Algorithm Implementations. Please write JUnits for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to algoholism](https://github.com/agrawalnishant/algoholism/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit."

## Coding conventions
of url('/images/blah.gif'), use url('../images/blah.gif').

Thanks,
Nishant Agrawal, for algoholism
