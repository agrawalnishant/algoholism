# Welcome to Algoholism!

[Algoholism](https://github.com/agrawalnishant/algoholism) is a repository of code that I write to improve my understanding of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science.

While learning and implementing DS & Algos, I get crazy Ideas that are a fusion of my learning and my observations and thoughts.
Will try to note them as well.

### References
Over the years, I have referred different books and online content, to learn and implement.
Following are the main among those: 
1. Intro to Algos. by Coreman
2. Algorithms Design Manual - by Skiena
3. Data Structures and Algos - by Karumanchi
4. [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io).

### Data Structures

Following is the list of Data Structures implemented here:
```markdown
Trees
# 

Graphs
#

```

### Algorithms

Following are the Algorithms implemented here:

```markdown
Sorting
#

Dynamic Programming
#

```

### Crazy Ideas
```markdown
Data Structure Ideas
#

Algorithm Ideas
# There probably is a way to solve some DP problems using bits, especially those including arrangement of Numeric Digits.

```
