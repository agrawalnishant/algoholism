# Welcome to Algoholism!

[Algoholism](https://github.com/agrawalnishant/algoholism) has code to improve my understanding of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science.

While learning and implementing DS & Algos, I get crazy Ideas that are a fusion of my learnings, observations, and thoughts.
Will try to note them as well.

### Salient Features
Have tried to improve quality and understandability of code using:
- [Junit5 Parameterized Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests)
- [Fluent Logging](https://github.com/google/flogger)

### References
Over the years, I have referred different books and online content, to learn and implement.
Following are the main among those: 
1. Intro to Algos. by Coreman
2. Algorithms Design Manual - by Skiena
3. Data Structures and Algos - by Karumanchi
4. [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io).

### Data Structures

Following is the list of Data Structures implemented here:
```markdown
Trees
# 

Graphs
#

```

### Algorithms

Following are the Algorithms implemented here:

```markdown
Sorting
#

Dynamic Programming using Naive / BruteFOrce, Top-Down using Memoization, and Bottoms-Up using Table.
# Fibonacci
# Knapsack Maximization
# Starcase Hops
# Equal Sub Partitions
# Longest Common Substring
# Smallest Common Super Sequence
```

### Crazy Ideas
```markdown
Data Structure Ideas
#

Algorithm Ideas
# There probably is a way to solve some DP problems using bits, especially those including arrangement of Numeric Digits.

```
